# Work-scheduler

## About
The webpage is to make a scheduler that allows the user to allot items into time slots and save them.
It has a slot for each hour of the day. To input and save the information, the user must click on the grey rectangles, type in their message and click the blue save button that corresponds to the correct time slot chosen. If the user does not click the save button, if the page is refreshed the message will not persist.
